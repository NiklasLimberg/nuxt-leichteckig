## Abstract

“It’s a trap” - a call or feeling we all might be familiar with, not only when it comes to Star Wars. It’s signalizing a sudden moment of noticing imminent danger. This situation is a nice allegory for an unpleasant realization in testing. Imagine having the best intentions when it comes to testing, but still ending up with tests failing to deliver you any value at all? Tests who are feeling like a pain to deal with?

When writing frontend tests, there are lots of pitfalls on the way. In sum, they can lead to bad maintainability, slow execution time, and - in the worst-case - tests you cannot trust. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In this session, I will talk about the common mistakes developers make, at least from my experience. And of course, on how to avoid them. Testing doesn’t need to be painful, after all.
