## Abstract

We will briefly review some basic principles and patterns that can be used to counter unstable tests and 
which problems can even be traced back to shortcomings of the application.

As cypress allows extensive request handling we will introduce into testing and mocking of requests. Building on this 
knowledge we explain how to implement API testing with cypress. Finally, tests over multiple domains in cypress 
are possible. So we dive into cypress approach discuss the challenges.

We give some suggestions on how to structure and organize your tests in order to retain your overview even in larger 
projects. How do I test if my application also looks correctly? We cover this with Visual Regression Test and show 
how a free platform can simplify the handling.

Finally, for component and library developers we explain component testing. The steps to get Cypress into an 
automatic build pipeline are essential and therefore last part of our workshop.
