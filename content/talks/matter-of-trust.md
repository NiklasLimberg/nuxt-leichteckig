## Abstract

Our daily work at Shopware, but also at agencies, ends up in the hands of people who trust us not only to have done our best, but also that it works. It is our job to instill this trust. Fortunately, we developers have a way to ensure something like that: Testing! Let's discover in this talk how we approach automated testing in Shopware, how far we have come on this journey, and what we have gained so far.
