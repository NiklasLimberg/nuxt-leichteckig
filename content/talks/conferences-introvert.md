## Abstract

Large crowds full of strangers. Many sounds. Senses on overdrive. A large, noisy conference is the antithesis of what we introverts prefer and crave. Even being remote isn't always a plus - this little black box you call camera and these features of meeting random people can be just as daunting. You can relate? If yes, you're just like me and 30-50 percent of the population, as research suggests. Wait, you might think, even me, as a speaker? Yes, this still fits together: Let me show you how you may start to enjoy conferences, even if you are not as much of an extrovert as you think you need to be.
