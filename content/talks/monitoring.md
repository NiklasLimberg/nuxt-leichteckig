## Abstract

Many developers and product managers are obsessed with all-green lighthouse scores. And for a good reason: Semantics, accessibility, and mobile performance are vital for a real-world application. But often, those measurements are only taken manually and at irregular intervals. How does a team of developers know if a merge request affects the application's performance negatively? By monitoring them all the time, manually? With automated performance testing, this can be easier to spot just by looking at code changes. In this session, learn how to set up tools like Lighthouse and Web Core Vitals in your CI and introduce performance thresholds to keep your frontend performance as high as possible.
